DESCRIPTION
*** Before run, please manually copy the SU file that you want to pick to this directory 

This steps is to perform break time picking which is crucial for every vsp job. 

SU provides good tools but not yet sophisticated and user friendly to do manual break time pick. The script for manual picking using ximage and button [s] functionality is BreakTimePick.sh

We are going to use automatic break time picking from SU, and smooth it a little bit using octave script, this will be done on FBAutoPick.sh

A QC of breaktime picking, besides visual QC, is to compute interval velocity, this will be done on DisplayPicks.sh.

The feature of transit time correction to seismic reference datum (SRD) through cosine correction has not been implemented.

HOW TO RUN
*** Before run, please manually copy the SU file that you want to pick to this directory for example copy the Z component file
$cp ../2Ela2D/Z.su .
