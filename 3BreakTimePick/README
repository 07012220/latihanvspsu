DESCRIPTION
This steps is to perform break time picking which is crucial for every vsp job. 

SU provides good tools but not yet sophisticated and user friendly to do manual break time pick. The script for manual picking using ximage and button [s] functionality is BreakTimePick.sh

We are going to use automatic break time picking from SU, and smooth it a little bit using octave script, this will be done on FBAutoPick.sh

A QC of breaktime picking, besides visual QC, is to compute interval velocity, this will be done on DisplayPicks.sh.

The feature of transit time correction to seismic reference datum (SRD) through cosine correction is implemented using Suttcor.sh. After the correction the SU data is referenced to SRD.

HOW TO RUN

- Manual Breaktime Picking
1. Open BreakTimePick.sh and change the input to what you need
2. run 
$./BreakTimePick.sh
3. After display data, move your cursor on break time and hit S on your keyboard
4. If you have finished your picking, close your window by pressing Q on your keyboard

-Automatic Breaktime Picking
1. Open FBAutoPicks.sh and change it as necesary to what you need
2. run 
$./FBAutoPicks.sh

-Display Picks, QC, and Smoothing
Run
1. Open DisplayPicks.sh and change it as necesary to what you need
$./DisplayPicks.sh

-After finishing break time pick, do geometric correction
1. Open Suttcor.sh and change it as necesary to what you need
$./Suttcor.sh
