DESCRIPTION
Here, we try to generate synthetic data and see what kind of VSP wave types. We will be using Ela2D (Falk,????). 
The input for this exercise is binary model (Vp,Vs,density) with [nx][nz], besides the flat model that generate earlier, you can make your own model. 
Output of this Ela2D modeling is horizontal and vertical component.

HOW TO RUN
0. Open CreateElasticSynthetic.sh, and modify as necessary based on comment on the script
1. Run Modeling, this may take sometimes, modeling is finished if there is no error, and you can see your data
$./CreateElasticSynthetic.sh

2. To display the synthetic data
$./DisplaySynthetic.sh
